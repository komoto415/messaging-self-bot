With that said, so long as you have all the packages imported and up to date, it will work on any Windows machine. The only really restriction is that you'r resolution has to be 1920x1080p with display scaling at 100% because that's what I based the region scalars off of for screenshotting. I'm there a way to generalise it, but hey, I'm tryna save on the search space for template matching. 

The other thing was the parsing for the messages. That as mostly a me things for my monkey brain just so i could put a name to the folder as well as the user ID. oonga boonga brain need nice word.

Oh, and I haven't a clue the versions of my particular packages.
# But seriously. 
With that said version 2, by all means extend this or fork it, because there certainly is a lot of refactoring that is needed to. But that's lter me problem. I've been trying to figure out a way I could do this headless, but it doesn't look possible :/ at least not with the amount of effort I want to put into it.
